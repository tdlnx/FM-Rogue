This is a project I put together to teach myself some new ways of manipulating data using FileMaker. Why not make something fun in the process?

Disclaimer: This isn't anywhere near complete so feel free to do whatever you want with it but don't expect a grand adventure just yet :)

All of the stuff I've written personally for this project is GPL licensed so feel free to take it and do whatever you want. If something isn't mine, I'll label it with a reference so you know where you can find more information in case you want to use something from this project in the future.

Have fun!
